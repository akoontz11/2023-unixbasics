# Command line basics
## ConGen 2021 (Online)

This session is meant to provide a broad overview of the command line interface, with a focus on the bash shell language. The lesson is based on publically available workshops from www.datacarpentry.org, as well as last year's lesson taught by Dr. Amanda Stahlke (https://gist.github.com/Astahlke). If all of this is old news to you, then feel free to skip it and tune in for next week's more advanced workshop on redirection, automation, scripts, and project organization. 

## Goals
By the end of this session, you should be familiar with the following. 
- moving around and viewing different directories on your system
- assessing available disk space and usage
- viewing and moving files 

```{bash}
ls
```
