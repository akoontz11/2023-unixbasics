# ConGen 2021: Command line basics

This session is meant to provide a broad overview of the command line interface, with a focus on the bash shell language. The lesson is based on publically available workshops from www.datacarpentry.org, as well as last year's lesson taught by Dr. Amanda Stahlke (https://gist.github.com/Astahlke). 

## Goals
By the end of this session, you should be familiar with the following. 
- moving around and viewing different directories on your system
- assessing available disk space and usage
- viewing and moving files 

If all of this is old news to you, then feel free to skip it and tune in for next week's more advanced workshop on redirection, automation, one-liners, scripts, and project organization.
