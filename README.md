# Hoban Lab Unix Training

A walkthough of basic Unix commands in a bioinformatic context. The exercise utilizes the [fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) software to analyze demo genetic data.

Adapted from a [tutorial](https://github.com/renaschweizer/congen-2021-unixbasics) by Dr. Rena Scwheizer, from a ConGen 2021 session on "Introduction to Command Line & Unix Basics".
